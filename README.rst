# ArkivverketObjectStorage - Simple object storage API for The National Archieves of Norway.

The goal is to abstract the details and provide a super-simple API towards various object
storage solutions.

Currently the API is implemented using Apache Libcloud and will only support a verified subset
of Libcloud.

The API is not meant for use outside the National Archieves.
